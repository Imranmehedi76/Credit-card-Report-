# Credit-card-Report-

I'm thrilled to share my latest data analytics project, where I built interactive dashboards using Power BI, 

with data extracted and transformed from a MySQL database. The goal was to uncover business insights from credit card transactions and customer data.

💳 Dashboard 1: Credit Card Transaction Report :

💰 Total Revenue: 57M+

🔢 Transaction Count: 10.29 K+

🏷️ Revenue by Card Category, Expenditure Type, and Chip Usage

📈 Trend analysis across quarters (Q1–Q4)

🎯 Customer acquisition costs and card performance breakdown


👥 Dashboard 2: Credit Card Customer Report :

📊 Gender-wise and Age-wise Revenue trends

🌍 Revenue by State and Education Level

👨‍💼 Insights by Occupation and Marital Status

🧠 CSS (Customer Satisfaction Score) and Total Income Tracking

📆 Time-series revenue analysis over 2023


Tech Stack Used :

 > MySQL – Data extraction & query optimization
 
 > Power BI – Data Modeling, DAX, and dashboard development
 
 > Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning.


 <> Key Insights from the Reports :

💳 Credit Card Transaction Report :

🔹 Blue Cards generated the highest revenue (~47M), interest, and annual fees.

🔹 Q4 saw the highest revenue and transaction volume, likely due to year-end spending.

🔹 Swipe transactions contributed 36M+, significantly more than chip or online usage.

🔹 Top spending categories: Bills (14M), Entertainment (10M), and Fuel (10M).

🔹 Customer acquisition cost was highest for Blue cards (0.90M), indicating a trade-off between value and cost.


👥 Credit Card Customer Report :

🔹 Male customers drive more revenue, especially in the 40–50 age range.

🔹 Customers with Graduate education contributed the highest revenue (23 M+).

🔹 Businessmen are the top customer group by revenue (~17.7M) and income (~190M).

🔹 Top states by revenue: CA, TX, NY.

🔹 Married customers spend more than single or unknown marital status groups.


These insights help in :

> Targeting high-value customer segments
 
> Optimizing card acquisition strategies

> Personalizing campaigns by geography, job, and education

> Enhancing channel effectiveness (e.g., promoting swipe usage)
